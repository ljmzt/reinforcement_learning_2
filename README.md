### Purpose
This repository contains files for some RL tests on the lunar lander gym. 

It follows heavily on [Hung-Yi Lee's lecture](https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~hylee/ml/2023-spring.php), [openai's baseline](https://github.com/openai/baselines/tree/master/baselines)(although in much simplified form), and this github [page](https://github.com/nikhilbarhate99/PPO-PyTorch/blob/master/train.py) and [this](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Hands-On)
It documents things I tried
